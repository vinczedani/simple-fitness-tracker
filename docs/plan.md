🧭 Overall Design Philosophy
Keep in mind the “in-motion” use case: users are mid-workout, sweaty, and glancing quickly at their screen. The core goals are:

Readability from a distance

One-tap interactions

Minimal distractions

Audio/visual cues over text

🧱 App Structure and Screens
Here’s a suggested structure with a few key screens/components:

1. Home Screen / Dashboard
Purpose: Central hub to start or customize workouts.

Components:

“Start Workout” button (primary CTA)

Recent or saved workouts (compact list)

Gear/settings icon for default config

Optional:

A quick config tile (e.g. “Tabata 20s/10s x 8”)

2. Workout Configuration Screen
Purpose: Create or customize your HIIT plan.

Sections:

Exercise time (e.g. 30s)

Rest time (e.g. 15s)

# of exercises / rounds

Total sets or duration

Optional:

Prep time before starting (e.g. 5s countdown)

Cooldown option

UX Ideas:

Sliders for time

Preset buttons: “Tabata,” “Custom,” “AMRAP”

Dynamic preview of workout structure

3. Workout Timer Screen
Purpose: Live HIIT session UI.

Design priorities:

Big countdown in center

Full-screen color background:

Green = Work

Red = Rest

Optional: Orange = Transition or upcoming

Other elements:

Exercise name (if defined)

Round indicator (e.g. “3 of 10”)

Visual timer ring or progress bar

Controls:

Pause / Resume

Skip / Previous (keyboard shortcut friendly)

Sound feedback: A must!

3–2–1 countdown beep

Ding on start/stop

4. Post-Workout Summary
Optional, but nice for UX closure.

Show:

Total duration

Rounds completed

Encourage user to “Save as preset” or “Share”

🎨 UX & Design Guidelines
Typography: Large, bold fonts.

Colors: Use minimal scheme, with color-coding for states. Avoid over-cluttered gradients or images.

Gestures: Support tap and swipe gestures if you go mobile-first.

Haptics (if mobile): Optional subtle buzz for transitions.

Keyboard support (web): Essential for trainers using laptop+projector.

⚙️ Feature Suggestions to Elevate the App
Voice guidance: “Start jumping jacks in 3...2...1”

Dark mode / Night workout mode

Mirror mode (for screen sharing on TVs)

Save / Share workouts

Integration with smartwatches or wearables (later phase)

🧪 Prototyping Tip
You can quickly mock this with Figma using their Smart Animate feature for transitions (like color changes, countdowns). Try starting with just:

Home screen

Timer screen with big central number

Settings modal or sheet

Once prototyped visually, you can translate it easily to React Native or Flutter depending on your platform.
